# Flask Application Design: NVDA Stock Price Tracker

## Overview
Our goal is to create a Flask application that enables users to track the stock price of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA). The application will display real-time stock prices and allow users to view historical data.

## HTML Files
The application will consist of the following HTML files:

1. **index.html**: This is the home page of the application. It will contain a simple layout with a title, a brief description of the app, and a link to the historical stock data page.
2. **historical.html**: This page will display a graph of the NVDA stock price over time. It will include options for users to select different time periods and view detailed information about specific data points.

## Routes
The application will have the following routes:

1. **Homepage**: The route to the homepage is '/' and it will serve the index.html file.
2. **Historical Data**: The route to the historical data page is '/historical' and it will serve the historical.html file.
3. **Stock Price**: This route is '/stock-price' and it will return the current NVDA stock price in JSON format. This route will be used to update the displayed stock price on the homepage in real time.

## Implementing the functionality
The application will utilize Python Flask's request handling capabilities to serve the appropriate HTML files and perform the necessary operations based on user input. Additionally, a suitable Python library or API will be integrated to retrieve real-time and historical stock data for NVDA.

With this structure in place, the application will provide users with a convenient and interactive way to track the stock price of NVDA.

**Additional Notes:**

- The real-time stock price data can be obtained through publicly available APIs or brokerages that offer such services.
- The design of the HTML files and the routes can be modified to accommodate additional features or a different layout.
- Implementing this application requires knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Python Flask.
